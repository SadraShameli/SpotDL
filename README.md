## A Python script to simplify downloading songs from Spotify

- The script will search for songs inside all **"*.txt"** files inside the **"urls/"** folder.

- Downloaded songs will be stored inside the **"downloaded/"** folder.

- Song files will have the following formatting for their names:<br>
`{{list-name}}/{{artists}} - {{title}}.{{output-ext}}`
